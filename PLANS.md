# Pickleball Vision Milestones

Milestones are intentionally sequential. Exactly one milestone is current. Work
outside the current milestone requires this plan to be deliberately updated first.

## 0. Foundation — complete

Establish repository instructions, architecture documentation, a typed Python
package, an installable CLI shell, environment-based configuration, structured
logging, error conventions, and automated quality checks.

Exit criteria:

- The documented repository structure exists.
- The vision package installs in a clean environment.
- `pickleball-vision doctor` reports a valid Foundation setup.
- Tests, Ruff checks, Ruff formatting, and static type checks pass.
- No video ingestion or computer-vision behavior was implemented.

## 1. Video ingestion — current

Read local video files through a reusable OpenCV boundary, expose source metadata,
extract a full-resolution frame by timestamp, and sample frames across the full
source duration. All commands validate their inputs and translate expected OpenCV
or filesystem failures into useful application errors.

Exit criteria:

- `pickleball-vision inspect <video>` reports the resolved source path, dimensions,
  non-integer FPS, frame count, duration in seconds, and codec when available.
- `pickleball-vision extract-frame` writes the requested valid frame without
  resizing it.
- `pickleball-vision sample-frames` selects the requested number of unique frames
  across the complete frame-index span rather than only from its beginning.
- Missing, non-file, unreadable, corrupt, invalid-timestamp, invalid-count, decode,
  and image-write failures produce stable, useful errors rather than raw OpenCV
  exceptions.
- Automated tests generate their own synthetic videos; no private footage is
  required or committed.
- Tests, Ruff checks, Ruff formatting, static type checks, and the CLI health check
  pass.
- No court calibration, detection, tracking, or product-service behavior is
  implemented.

Moving a milestone to current should add measurable entry and exit criteria while
preserving completed milestone history. Do not bundle later milestones into the
current one for convenience.
